# Procedural-Image-Reconstruction
The project uses a genetic evolution algorithm to reconstruct images by evolving brush strokes with properties like position, color, size, and opacity. A fitness function evaluates similarity between generated and target images. Through selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm evolves the population to converge towards a target-like image.
